# TalkWise_Flutter_GroupChatApp

A new Flutter project.
Used Firebase as Database
Here we have login/register page
The data gets stored in firebase
We can search groups that have been created or we can also create one
We have a drawable which consists of groups,profile and Logout options
In Profile we can see our UserName and EmailId 
And logout is used to logging out of the application
Here we can join the groups by searching them by using the search icon
After joining user can send messages.





*This app has few bugs related to toggling the join button, email formatting and admin isse(admin issue is when a person creates a group he/she cannot see the members of the group but all the other members can see it properly)*
